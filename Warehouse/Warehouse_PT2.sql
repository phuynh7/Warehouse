-- #3: List the phones and employee_no for all the managers
-- #4: List all the parts that are assemblies (have subparts). For each part, display the total number of subparts it has.
-- #5: Write a query that will tell you the total capacity in each warehouse. For each warehouse list the # of bins and the total capcity for those bins.
-- #6: For each manager,list all current and old backorders done by the manager. For each backorder you have to list the part_no, backorder date, and fulfilled date.
-- #7: For each warehouse bin, give the remaining capacity of the bin. Call the remaining capacity remaining_capacity.
-- #8: Answer the question, how many items are currently on backorder?
-- #9: Provide a list of batches for each warehouse- list the warehouse name, batch number, size, and date in.
-- #10: List the toatl number of batches for a particular part number.
